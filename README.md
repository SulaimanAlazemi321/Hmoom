# Hmoom

A reflection app I built for myself to track thoughts and personal reflections.

## What it does

Simple journaling app with user accounts, email verification, and Google login. Nothing fancy, just what I needed.

## If you want to use it

1. Clone this
2. Fill in your own keys in the `.env` file  
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `alembic upgrade head`
5. `python main.py`

Built with FastAPI and vanilla JavaScript.
